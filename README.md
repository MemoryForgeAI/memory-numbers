# Memory Numbers

Memory Numbers is a symbolic framework where numbers retain their transformation history — enabling new ways to model time, causality, entropy, and self-reflective learning.

## Summary

Instead of forgetting how they reached a value, Memory Numbers log every transformation applied to them.

This allows:
- Modeling of symbolic entropy and causal order
- Simulation of time as a product of internal change
- Development of AGI systems with transparent memory

## Features

- `MemoryNumber`: A number that remembers how it changed
- `MemoryTrace`: Sequence of all transformations
- `ReflectionAgent`: A basic agent that reflects and adapts
- Supports task solving, memory replay, and reset

## Try It Out

Run a basic demo from the project root:

python -m examples.simple_trace_demo

or Run Directly:

python examples/simple_trace_demo.py

You’ll see a number change step-by-step, and the system will trace each transformation applied.
