# Memory Numbers

**Memory Numbers** is a novel mathematical and symbolic framework where numbers retain a trace of their transformation history.

This allows modeling:
- The arrow of time
- Emergent entropy
- Causality chains
- Symbolic memory in intelligent systems

## 🔧 Key Concepts

- `MemoryNumber`: A number that records every operation applied to it.
- `MemoryEntropy`: A new form of entropy based on transformation complexity.
- `MemoryTrace`: Logs of operations that simulate causality.

## 🧪 Applications

- AGI memory systems
- Simulations of time and entropy
- Symbolic machine reasoning
- AI safety through traceability

## 📁 Structure

- `memory_numbers.py`: Core class definitions
- `examples/`: Demos and simulations
- `tests/`: Unit tests for framework logic
